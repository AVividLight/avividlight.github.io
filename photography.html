                <p class="album-description">It's easy to live inside my own little bubble, content to wile away my days with an unending list of travesties and pleasures, each emerging at my very feet, and happening, most importantly, to me. Street photography helps to remind me that although we are all unique, we are united by our individuality. Every thought that I have can be matched with that of someone else, and although I stand alone in some sense, I am in good company.</p>

					<p>Amid the plethora of construction in downtown Minneapolis, several bastions of color can be found. Although they may often go unnoticed by busy people running to and fro, these serene oases make for a picturesque respit in the middle of a busy life.</p>

                <p class="album-description">Architectural photography is not considered as dynamic as streetphotography, as iconic as portraits, nor as meaningful as documentary photography, but it has a special place in my heart due to its implicit showcase of humanity. Although rarely do they feature a human itself, architectural photography is a testament to our ingenuity, creativity, and what we can accomplish when we put aside our differences, and work together for a nobler goal.</p>

					<p>Although downtown Minneapolis doesn't feel that big, it boasts a significant history, leading back to the early industrial expansion of the United States. Emerging industries like textile production and milling relied on flowing water to power their factories, and Minneapolis proved an enticing home, being situated on the Mississippi river. Luckily, much of the character, and some of the buildings themselves, has been preserved to this day, and that's what I wanted to capture in this album.</p>

					<p>City streets aren't always clean, and the buildings thereon are not always well-kept. An evolving city behaves much like a living entity, to the extent that growth requires significant resources, and it's not always realistic to keep up parts that are old or otherwise dying. Once proud neighborhoods and faded landmarks are eventually turned over to become new, but in the twilight of this transformation, a unique magic can be found. I want to highlight the disparity between prosperous and destitute here.</p>
